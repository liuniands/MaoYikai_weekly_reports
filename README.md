My code's style draws on others to some extent.

Everyone can check my code and if you have any problem or think it can be improved, please contact me.

## Week 1
1. Learning hours: About 20 hours. (Maybe 2 hours per day in weekdays, 4-5 hours in weekends.)

2. Learning progress: Have relearned C/C++ to the function and pointer, learned the basic of linux and linux network programming.

3. Your implementation of the tasks you have done this week: Know how to code basic UDP/TCP server and client, how to code basic multi-process and multi-thread        server, and how to code a IO Multiplexing Server with Select.

4. Unsolved problems: Probably no question at the moment.

5. Plan for the next week: C/C++, linux, linux IO model(epoll and others).
